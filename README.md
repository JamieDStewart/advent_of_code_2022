# Advent of Code 2022

This repository is for my C++ answers to the Advent of Code 2022.
I've laid this out in the structure that each day is a new sub folder with source files contained within that releate to each day, as the days progress they will no doubt share code from previous day's questions. I'm simply going to duplicate this in each sub folder leaving each days code to reflect the challenges up to that point. I'll be using modern C++ and commenting this code as thoroughly as I can.
