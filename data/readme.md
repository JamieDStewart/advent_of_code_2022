# Data Files

This folder contains text files that contain the data that is required for each of the daily questions from the Advent of Code. 
The files are named for the day they they are associated with, files that end in '_sample' are sample data take from the questions themselves and used to establish that the code for the question is behaving as demonstrated in the context of the questions (each advent of code question contains an example data set this is what these files contain).  Files ending with '_input' are the downloaded input from the link provided on the daily question that is to be run with that days challenge.

Part of the advent of code is that input files are different for multiple users. So that's kind of fun.
